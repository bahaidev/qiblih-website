# qiblih-website

This is the source code of the <https://qiblih.com/> website.

The `public` folder gets deployed to the <https://www.netlify.com/> web host.

The code needs to be updated to be compatible with the recent Google Maps
API changes.

This does not currently include the source of the <http://qiblih.nfshost.com/m/>
site that [@janrg]( https://github.com/janrg ) developed.
